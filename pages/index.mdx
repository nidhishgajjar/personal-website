## Arts and Sciences: The Duality of Creation ~ *nidhish*

*We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. Medicine, law, business, engineering—these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love... these are what we stay alive for.*

— *Robin Williams, Dead Poets Society*

## Marketing is About Values ~ *sj*

*Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently—they're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.*

## Best one from Friedrich Nietzsche

*Those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music.*

## an ancient Japanese saying

*Expect nothing, seek nothing, grasp nothing.*

## Trust the Process

*Dhoni finishes off in style! A magnificent strike into the crowd. India lift the World Cup after 28 years! The party starts in the dressing room, and it's an Indian captain who's been absolutely magnificent on the night of the final.*
